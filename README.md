# React Fundamentals project
This is my submission for the first project in [React Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/react-nanodegree--nd019).

The project is forked from the [starter template](https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-myreads-starter).

## Setup
Simply run ```npm install``` and ```npm start``` to start the project in developer mode.

## Dependencies
### Backend server
The project depends on a backend server provided by Udacity. As long as that server is running, this project will continue to work.

## Important
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.
